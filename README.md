# Hello There

This my project readme outline. I will update this as I progress in my project

My intent for this project is to demonstrate my Git/GitHub, Python, and Tableau knowledge. The Python portion of my project is geared toward data analysis.

## My Project 
Text Here

1. Running the program will do the following:
    1. Outline step 1 
    2. Outline step 2 
    3. Outline step 3
    4. Finally the program will create and save a .jpg file titled with the selected year.

I chose this project to show my skills because I am an analyst for a local homebuilder. I wanted to do a project that shows my skills and also furthers my knowledge on a work subject. I sourced my data from Zonda Home and Landvision.

### My Project Features
Below is information on how to run the program followed by the features I selected to meet my project requirements:

#### Steps to Run My Program:

1. Clone my repository 
2. Navigate to the directory where your virtual environment will be created
    1. Create your virtual environment
    2. Install the required packages using my generated requirements.txt. I created requirements.txt on a windows machine. 
    <>For those on other Operating Systems I created a pared down version named requirements_multi_OS.txt
3. Run main.py from your command prompt:
    1. Create list here
        1. Create sublist here
        
**Thats it! Now on to how I met my project requirements below.**

#### Git / GitHub

I continued my utilization of Git and furthered my knowledge on the subject during this project. I learned Git terminal command using GitBash.  I tried to make commits anytime I made changes and pushed those commits to my GitHub repository. Check out my commit history on this project [Here](https://github.com/dust39/real_estate_analysis_2022/commits/main). Below are the Git terminal commands I learned and used most often.

- Git init : to initialize my local repository.
- Git status: to check the status of any file changes in my local repository.
- Git add: to add my changed files to a staging area.
- Git commit: to commit my changed files.
- Git push: to push my local commits up to my GitHub repository.

## Conclusion
Is there ever a conclusion in technology??? I learned so much working on this project. It may seem simple on the surface, but the amount the I have learned is incredible. I loved the challenge and I look forward to continuing my coding adventure. Thank You to Code Kentucky for this opportunity and Thank You for looking at my project!
